I'm currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in Linguistics at the Department of Humanities of the University of Turin. I'm working within the PRIN PNRR 2022 project ["DiverSITa: Diversity in spoken Italian"](https://site.unibo.it/divers-ita/en) which aims to expand the KIParla corpus of spoken Italian (Mauri et al. 2019) by including data of Italian L2 speakers currently living in Turin and Bologna.
My research interests involve Semantics and Pragmatics within the frameworks of Cognitive Linguistics and Construction Grammar. I work on various languages such as Russian and Italian. Lately, I've been working on language contact and multilingualism too.
